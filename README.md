# Testing the new architecture's limits

Just a quick test app to validate a few doubts I have been having - basically, I'm starting with a fresh new RN app on latest stable (0.70.3) and throwing a bunch of libs at it to see what works and what doesn't when enabling the new architecture.

## Tests matrix

A few things to notice:

- technically, to turn on the new arch you have just one switch, [see here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/the-new-architecture/use-app-template#enable-the-new-architecture). This means both TM and Fabric ON at the same time.
  - there are "less known" ways to only switch ON one or the other. So we'll test all the options. (also: I'm not sure if this will work on >=71)
- ~At the end, when everything else is tested, I'll also try to switch on ConcurrentReact and see what goes kaboom.~ by default, when turning ON the new arch, concurrent is ON too - [read more](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/react-18-and-react-native#react-18-enabled-by-default).
- I picked the libs pretty much on instinct, using [directory](https://reactnative.directory/) as a catalogue.
- I'm stickying with Hermes only for now just for time-related reasons

As base test, I'll:

- try to switch on new arch âœ…
- try to switch on TM only ðŸŸ¡
- try to switch on Fabric only ðŸŸ¡

Then I'll move to the meat of this experiment: the idea is that I'll add all these libs into the code, and see what happens.

## TODO

âœ… add "status code" to show which state the thing is in (old/new arch, concurrent on/off) (hats off to [@tido64](https://github.com/tido64) for [this](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app/blob/trunk/example/App.js#L159-L169))
ðŸŸ¡ do basic tests
ðŸŸ¡ add libraries and sample code one by one, in old arch
ðŸŸ¡ do the tests (new arch on first)
ðŸŸ¡ get the app in shape for turning on in new arch proper
ðŸŸ¡ summarize the whole thing into some learnings
